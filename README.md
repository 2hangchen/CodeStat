`CodeStat` is a local metrics tool that analyzes how you use AI coding assistants:
how many lines are generated by AI, how many are kept, and how this evolves over time.

## Features

- **Global dashboard for all data**  
  - AI generated lines, adopted lines, adoption & generation rates  
  - File count, session count, quick bar chart overview

- **Multi‑dimension queries**  
  - **By file**: see how much of a file comes from AI and how much you kept  
  - **By session**: analyze one coding session with detailed diff lines  
  - **By project**: aggregate metrics for an entire repository

- **Agent / model comparison**  
  - Compare multiple sessions (agents / models / settings) side‑by‑side  
  - See which one actually produces more adopted code instead of just more tokens

- **Local‑first & privacy‑friendly**  
  - All metrics are computed locally from your own diffs  
  - No source code or prompts are sent to any remote service

- **Nice CLI UX**  
  - Rich‑based tables & colors, arrow‑key navigation  
  - Minimal but informative header (MCP status + repo info)

## Typical Workflows

- **Measure your own AI usage**  
  - Record one or more coding sessions with your IDE + MCP server  
  - Run `CodeStat` and inspect:
    - AI generated vs adopted lines
    - Which files receive the most AI help

- **Compare agents / models / prompts**  
  - Map different sessions to different agents / models  
  - Use **Compare Agents** to get a per‑session comparison table

- **Project‑level health check**  
  - For a given repo, run project metrics to see:
    - Where AI contributes the most
    - Whether AI‑generated code is actually being kept
